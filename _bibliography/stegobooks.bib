  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a method for normalization of rich feature sets to improve detection accuracy of simple classifiers in steganalysis. It consists of two steps: 1) replacing random subsets of empirical joint probability mass functions (co-occurrences) by their conditional probabilities and 2) applying a non-linear normalization to each element of the feature vector by forcing its marginal distribution over covers to be uniform. We call the first step random conditioning and the second step feature uniformization. When applied to maxSRMd2 features in combination with simple classifiers, we observe a gain in detection accuracy across all tested stego algorithms and payloads. For better insight, we investigate the gain for two image formats. The proposed normalization has a very low computational complexity and does not require any feedback from the stego class.},

  abstract={Currently, the most popular detectors of content-adaptive image steganography are built using machine learning with images represented with rich features. Such high-dimensional descriptors, however, prevent utilization of more complex and potentially more accurate machine learning paradigms, such as kernelized support vector machines, due to infeasibly expensive training. In this paper, we demonstrate that explicit non-linear feature maps coupled with simple classifiers improve the accuracy of current steganalysis detectors built as binary classifiers as well as quantitative detectors in the form of payload regressors. The non-linear map is obtained by approximating a symmetric positive semi-definite kernel on selected pairs of cover features. Exponential forms of kernels derived from symmetrized Ali-Silvey distances improve the detection accuracy of binary detectors and lower the error of quantitative detectors across all tested steganographic schemes on grayscale and color images. The learned non-linear map only weakly depends on the cover source and its learning has a low computational complexity. The technique can also be used for unsupervised feature dimensionality reduction. For payload regressors, the dimensionality can be significantly reduced while simultaneously decreasing the estimation error.},

Currently, most side-informed schemes utilize a high-quality “precover” image that is subsequently processed and then jointly quantized and embedded with a secret. In this paper, we investigate an alternative form of side-information-a set of multiple JPEG images of the same scene-for applications when the sender does not have access to a precover. The additional JPEG images are used to determine the preferred polarity of embedding changes to modulate the costs of changing individual DCT coefficients in an existing embedding scheme. Tests on real images with synthesized acquisition noise and on real multiple acquisitions obtained with a tripod-mounted and hand-held digital camera show a rather significant improvement in empirical security with respect to steganography utilizing a single JPEG image. The proposed empirically determined modulation of embedding costs is justified using Monte-Carlo simulations by showing that qualitatively the same modulation minimizes the Bhattacharyya distance between a quantized generalized Gaussian model of cover and stego DCT coefficients corrupted by AWG acquisition noise.},

  abstract = {Steganography is the art of covert communication. Its goal is achieved by hiding secret messages into innocuous objects such as digital images, audio files, etc. As any other technology, steganography can be used for malicious purpose. The need to detect steganographic objects give rise to steganalysis, a complementary task to steganography. The main focus of this dissertation is on steganalysis of JPEG images, as the JPEG image format is nowadays the most frequently used image format. In the first part of the dissertation, a detector recognizing six popular steganographic algorithms is presented. This detector is novel in many ways. First, it not only detects the presence of a secret message, but also assigns the image to a class according to the algorithm used to embed the message. Second, it detects stego content in single-compressed as well as in double-compressed JPEG images. Third, it offers superior accuracy in comparison to prior art. The detector is based on feature extraction and supervised training of two banks of multi-classifiers implemented by Support Vector Machines. The first bank targeted to single-compressed images contains a separate multi-classifier trained for each JPEG quality factor from a certain range. Another bank of multi-classifiers is trained for double-compressed images for the same range of primary quality factors. Multi-classifier banks are preceded by a pre-classifier detecting double-compression and estimating the primary quantization table. The second part of the dissertation presents a method for benchmarking security of steganographic algorithms. We argue that a good benchmark should be dependent only on the model chosen to represent cover and stego objects (feature set). While the KL divergence would be a preferable measure, because it is a fundamental quantity, there are practical difficulties in computing it. Therefore a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is proposed as a measure of steganographic security, because it is well understood theoretically, and is numerically stable even in high-dimensional spaces.},
